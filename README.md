# Welcome to my project 
# This is Plateau NFT marketplace 
# Simple NFT marketplace and minting framework working on Ethereum's Rinkeby test network.
# To run your local version of this marketplace:
# 1) Download the source code
# 2) Run npm init to download dependancies
# 3) Run npm start to start the server

# I advise to deploy a fresh copy of the contract, if you want to fork the project.
